name="Annotated Screenshot"
description="Captures the active 2D, 3D, or Game viewport and appends a labelled property panel beneath it, producing a single annotated PNG. An editor dock lets you browse every node in the scene through a collapsible category/group/property tree (matching the Inspector layout), tick exactly which values to include, and hit one button to save. Supports resource sub-properties, enum/flag named values, and an optional companion .txt file. Saved files land in res://screenshots/."
